When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When I plan common work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   It's need to save you files in GitHub repository and in local repository in uptodate condition.
