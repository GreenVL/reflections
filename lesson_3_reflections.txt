When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When I plan common work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   It's need to save you files in GitHub repository and in local repository in uptodate condition.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   Fork put other repository to your repository. Clone put repository form GitHub to local working directory.
